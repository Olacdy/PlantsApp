## Description

Rooms plants application allows users to keep records of their room plants, set plant photo, name, and watering frequency. The application will automatically calculate the remaining time and rearrange the plant to a section of plants that need a watering session.

Users will be notified if there are some unwatered plants left, so they don't need to keep in mind every other information about their plants.
